In an LA zone, a walk-through body shower at the critical doors of the animal cubicles or PM rooms that exit to a \u201cclean\u201d corridor allows personnel to remove all contamination before exiting to the \u201cclean\u201d corridor, \u201cclean\u201d change room, or areas outside the containment zone. At CL4, the walk-through body shower provides an essential redundancy to prevent the release of regulated materials. The body shower is an extension of the \u201cdirty\u201d change area and is, therefore, within the boundaries of the containment barrier. The location and the number of anterooms with a walk-through body shower are determined by the function of the containment zone and the activities taking place.",

            "requirement_notes": "The biosecurity plan details the mitigation strategies for countering potential biosecurity events identified in the biosecurity risk assessment. Mitigation strategies are implemented to address personnel security and prevent the loss, theft, misuse, diversion, or intentional unauthorized release of biological assets (i.e., regulated materials) and related facility assets (e.g., equipment, non-infectious material, animals, sensitive information). Mitigation strategies for personnel security always include suitability assessment and ongoing reliability assessment. Mitigation strategies for physical security include barriers, access controls, intrusion detection, protocols for granting and revoking authorized access, and protocols for maintaining entry and exit logs for the containment zone. Mitigation strategies also serve to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or to containment zones and areas where regulated materials are handled or stored. Mitigation strategies related to information management often include information protection, information classification, and SOPs for appropriate storage of electronic information and hard copies. Training and awareness of the biosecurity plan (e.g., with workshops or functional and tabletop exercises) ensures mitigation strategies are followed. Biosecurity training can also include training on incident reporting (e.g., loss or theft of regulated materials), facility policies on appropriate use of electronic devices and social media, and recognizing social engineering or suspicious behaviour from insider threats. Evaluation and review of the biosecurity plan supports the continued improvement of the overall biosafety program, and may be done following an incident, changes in program intent (e.g., working with a new pathogen, gain-of-function research), or any other situation that may affect the biosecurity plan (e.g., facility renovations). The biosecurity plan can be developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts (e.g., scientists, cybersecurity specialists, security practitioners, external consultants) and approved by senior management.",

The HVAC system and HVAC system components are tested through a variety of failure scenarios to demonstrate that they can continue to maintain minimum operating parameters (established during commissioning) to prevent a breach of containment and the release of infectious aerosols and aerosolized toxins from the containment zone or from a Class II B2 BSC. In the event of an exhaust fan failure, Class II B2 BSCs can produce a reversal of airflow from the face of the BSC (i.e., puff-back) as a result of a delayed reaction to a shutdown. Every effort is made to minimize puff-backs mechanically (e.g., interlocked supply blower brake, automated isolation damper on BSC air supply). Where puff-back cannot be eliminated, it can be minimized by changing physical parameters for the equipment (i.e., duration and airflow velocity as low as achievable) and implementing additional operational mechanisms that address the risks associated with the puff-back, based on the regulated materials, and procedures in use. Examples of operational mechanisms include the use of additional PPE (e.g., respirator, face protection) by all personnel in the immediate work area, and posting emergency protocols to be followed in the event that puff-back occurs.

        "Terrestrial animal pathogen transfer permit": "A permit issued under paragraph 51.1(a) of the Health of Animals Act by the Public Health Agency of Canada or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for the transfer of terrestrial animal pathogens or part of one (e.g., toxins); or animals, animal products, animal by-products (e.g., tissue, serum), or other organisms carrying a terrestrial animal pathogen or part of one (e.g., toxin).",
        "(Microbial) Toxin": "A poisonous substance that is produced by or derived from a microorganism and can lead to adverse health effects in humans or animals. Human toxins are listed in Schedule 1 and Part 1 of Schedule 5 in the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act.",
        "Training needs assessment": "An evaluation performed to identify the current and future training needs of the facility (i.e., organization, containment zone), including training, refresher training, and retraining, and to identify gaps in the current training program.",
        "Transfer": "A change in possession of regulated materials between individuals from the same or different facilities (i.e., the movement from the place or places specified in the licence or terrestrial animal pathogen import permit to any other place).",
        "Transportation": "The act of transporting (e.g., shipping, conveyance) regulated materials to another building or location (i.e., different address), within Canada or abroad, in accordance with the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and Regulations.",
        "Trigger quantity": "The minimum quantity above which a toxin regulated under the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act is considered a \u201cprescribed toxin\u201d and, therefore, a security sensitive biological agent, as described by subsection 10(2) of the Human Pathogens and Toxins Regulations.",
        "Validation": "The act of confirming that a method achieves its objective and is suitable for its intended purpose through the provision of objective evidence. This can be achieved by observing that specific conditions have been met (e.g., using biological indicators, chemical integrators, or parametric monitoring devices placed in challenging locations within the load to confirm that a given autoclave cycle can decontaminate a representative load of waste).",
        "Ventilated cage changing station": "Equipment specifically designed to change bedding and other contents from animal cages that:a) directs the air away from the user into the interior of the unitat a sufficient velocity to protect the user from potentialexposure to regulated materials; andb) filters the exhaust air prior to release from the unit, therebypreventing the potential release of regulated materials intothe environment.",
        "Verification": "The routine monitoring of equipment and processes to confirm continued efficacy between validations (e.g., testing the performance of an autoclave using biological indicators, viewing airflow gauges to confirm fan function in a biological safety cabinet). Verification includes comparing the accuracy of a piece of equipment to an applicable standard or standard operating procedure.",
        "Virulence": "The degree or severity of a disease caused by a pathogen.",
        "Waste": "Any solid or liquid material generated by a facility for disposal.",
        "Work surface": "A surface in the containment zone on which work is conducted. Examples include benchtops, tables, and surfaces within biological safety cabinets.",
        "Zoonoses": "Diseases transmissible between living animals and humans. Zoonoses include anthropozoonoses (i.e., diseases transmitted from animals to humans) and zooanthroponoses, also known as reverse zoonoses (i.e., diseases transmitted from humans to animals).",
        "Zoonotic pathogen": "A pathogen that causes disease in humans and animals, and that can be transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa (i.e., zoonoses). T"
